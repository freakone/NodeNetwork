The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for the ST 
'STM32F303VC' microcontroller using ST 'STM32F3-Discovery' Evaluation Board.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL (ST-Link) =    8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK         =   72.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:


- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32F303 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F303 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
